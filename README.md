# Career-Connect-JAVA
AIM: 
The aim of this project is to develop a web application that can help students, alumni, and placement cell of an educational institution to interact and collaborate with each other. The project intends to create a user-friendly and secure platform that can offer various features such as alumni testimonials, upcoming events, chat with alumni, job postings, online tests, and campus placements. The project also seeks to enhance the networking, learning, and career opportunities of the users by connecting them with the relevant alumni and employers.

Methodology Used: 
Some of the methodologies used for developing the web application are:
•	Java: as the programming language for creating the server-side logic and functionality of the application. Java is a widely used, object-oriented, and platform-independent language that offers high performance, security, and scalability.
•	Java Server Pages (JSP): as the technology for creating the dynamic web pages of the application. JSP is a server-side technology that allows the use of Java code, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to generate web content.
•	JavaScript: as the scripting language for adding interactivity and functionality to the web pages. JavaScript is a versatile, lightweight, and powerful language that can manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) and communicate with the server.
•	HTML and CSS: as the standard web technologies for creating the structure, style, and layout of the web pages. HTML and CSS are the core technologies of the web that enable the creation of responsive, mobile-first, and customizable web applications.
•	MySQL: as the relational database management system for storing and retrieving the data of the application. MySQL is a reliable, open-source, and efficient database that supports various data types, transactions, and queries.
